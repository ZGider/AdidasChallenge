# AdidasChallenge

This is the automation testing framework built for testing the AdidasChallenge Android Application.

In this Framework I used;

**JAVA**                as Programming Language, 
**SELENIUM**            as Automation Library,
**APPIUM**              as Android Automation Tool,
**TESTNG**              as Testing Tool,
**MAVEN**               as Building Management Tool,
**EXTENT REPORTS**      as Reporting Library,
**PAGE OBJECT MODEL**   as Testing Design Pattern,
**GITHUB**              as Version Control System,
**INTELLIJ**            as IDE,
**ANDROID STUDIO**      for Creating Virtual Android Devices,
**EXCEL**               for Project Management and Bug Reporting.


REMINDER:

After running any of the TestCases, to view the result report as expected, please follow
the steps below;

* Open the "test-output" folder in the IDE
* Right click the "report.html" file.
* Hover Over "Open in" / Click "Finder" (In Mac)
* Click "Show In Folder" (In Windows)
* Right click report.html / Open with Chrome Browser

NOTE : 

In the resources file there is an excel file which includes;

* Epics,
* User Stories belog to the Epics,
* Test Cases belong to the Test Cases,
* Bug Reports for the failed Test Cases,
  
created by me according to the given conditions and data in the assignment.

As mentioned in the excel file, some of the TestCases have been done manually, some of them
have been automated. By Manual Tests and by Automated Tests, some Bugs have been found.
Manually found bugs are only reported in the excel file, but the Bugs detected by the Automated 
Tests can also be examined by the Test Report which have been created automatically with the
help of Extent Reports Library. And also there are also a lot details and statistics in the
Extent Report about the automatically run Test Cases.
